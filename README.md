1 step Datapreparation (Datapreparation with HSV Color channel transfer, You can Skip this Process)

2 step G.S Train& Validation

3 step G.S Test&confusion matrix

#check that if code not working properly 
(1)you must open visdom server("python -m visdom.server" typing in anaconda) 
(2)Linear node number in net(change according to input size) 
(3)Data Download and Save path&Load Path 
(4)GPU Setting for Pytorch(Driver install..etc)

#Comment
i made this code When i worked in Korea Government-funded research institute as Research Assistante in 8 Months 
without Background Knowledge about Python and Gravity Spy
So as reason This code it will be awkward but it work properly my computer(Windows,Titan V GPU,Python 3.7.8)
you can change more efficiently.
